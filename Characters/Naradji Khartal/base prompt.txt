"Render a 2D animated-style digital illustration in a fusion of Disney and Studio Ghibli aesthetics. Show two divine, anthropomorphic khartals standing side by side in a softly glowing twilight forest. Their carved wooden bodies should have an elongated vertical finger hole placed exactly at the center of their height — just like traditional Indian kartals — with glowing brass cymbals slotted only into the sides (not the base).

Give them expressive, soulful cartoon eyes — one with a serene, meditative expression, the other slightly playful, both exuding sacred presence. Embellish their wooden surfaces with intricate Sanskrit carvings, floral temple designs, and mandala engravings.

Each khartal should radiate a subtle divine aura — a warm, golden shimmer inspired by Indian spiritual art (not halos). Floating between them, display the mantra ‘Om Namo Narayanaya’ in elegant English script, rippling like sacred sound.

Surround them with lush, Ghibli-like forest elements: soft mist, glistening foliage, floating lotus petals, and magical ambient lighting. The mood should feel spiritual, whimsical, mythic, and alive — as if part of a sacred animated tale blending Indian divinity with Disney–Ghibli storytelling magic."
