ðŸŸ¥ Prayag â€“ The Bold Protector (Updated)
"A tall Indian boy around 10â€“11 years old, the tallest of the group. He has a lean, upright frame and bold features: sharp eyebrows, deep-set eyes, and a calm, protective expression. His head is shaved with a traditional choti (a small tuft at the back). He wears a long white jubho (kurta) that drapes past his waist, paired with a white dhoti â€” his waist is not tied or exposed. Around his neck is a double-stranded Vaishnav kanthi made of small wooden beads. On his forehead is a yellow U-shaped tilak with a centered red circular chandlo. He stands tall, poised, and dignified â€” like a young guardian. Illustrated in a warm, painterly Ghibli-Disney style with soft light and earth tones."
