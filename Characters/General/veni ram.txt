ðŸŸ¨ Veni Ram â€“ The Playful Heart
"A chubby Indian boy around 9 years old, second tallest. He has round cheeks, a small gap in his front teeth, and big, mischievous brown eyes. His hair is thick and curly, tied loosely into a small puffed topknot bun. He wears a short white dhoti, sometimes a loose cloth around the shoulder, and a double-stranded small-bead Vaishnav kanthi. A yellow U-shaped tilak with a circular red chandlo sits on his forehead. Cheerful, energetic, and full of movement. Drawn in Ghibli-Disney fusion style with soft brush lines."
