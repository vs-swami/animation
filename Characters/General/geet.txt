ðŸŸ© Geet (Ghanshyam) â€“ The Divine Soul (Updated)
"A serene Indian boy around 8 years old, with a calm and spiritual presence. His build is modest, and he stands slightly shorter than Veni Ram. He has curly-wavy hair, medium-length, softly framing his gentle face. His eyes are wide and tranquil. He wears a clean white dhoti, a simple yellow kurta, and a double-stranded Vaishnav kanthi with small wooden beads. His tilak is a bright U-shaped yellow mark with a red â€˜oâ€™-shaped chandlo perfectly centered between the arms. He has a very subtle divine aura, a soft glow that enhances his peaceful energy without drawing attention. The style remains warm, textured, and painterly â€” a blend of Studio Ghibli and Disney."
