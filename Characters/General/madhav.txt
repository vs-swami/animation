ðŸŸ¦ Madhav â€“ The Gentle Thinker
"A small Indian boy around 7 years old, the shortest of the group. He has short, neatly combed hair and gentle, innocent eyes. His expression is thoughtful or quietly smiling. He wears a white dhoti, a small dark green shoulder cloth, and a double-stranded small-bead kanthi. His forehead bears the yellow U-shaped tilak with a perfectly centered red circular chandlo. His posture is humble and reserved. Set in soft, golden Ghibli-Disney tones with light forest or village atmosphere."
